# meeting with Jemac

On monday 27th of november a meeting was held with Jemac. During the meeting we discussed how the project for electroverkstaden might be executed. The meeting was held because we are planing to use Jemacs hardware in the project. Jemac would also like to continue to be involved in the project in the future if that is possible. When discussing the hardware we used the hardware specifications listed in the [README](/README.md)


## Thoughts from Jemac
Jemac would like to provide/take care of OS, driver for the connection and OTAs if that is needed in the future 

## Hardware
according to requirements defined in readme at the time of the meeting:
>2. The hardware device should have:
>   - 6 Digital Inputs (DI)
>   - 1 Analog Input (AI)
>   - 1 Digital Output (DO)

The hardware that Jemac has in mind has in mind have:

> - 6 Digital Input/output (DI/O)
> - 1 Analog input (AI)
> - 1 Analog (AO)

In order to match the requirements it might be possible to ure the AO as a DO

## Future work

Jemac could help us set up a lab enviroment on their hardware. They have an idea to make it a bit like arduino. Jemac suggested that LNU could write a requirement document.
