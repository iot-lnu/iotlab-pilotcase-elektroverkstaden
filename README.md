# Problem description 
Elektroverkstaden AB is facing limitations in extracting and analyzing data from their pump station services. They lack the ability to remotely monitor what happens within their pump operations, inhibiting their efficiencies and potential interventions. Consequently, there is a pressing need for real-time data analysis tools that can integrate into their existing systems. This also necessitates the inclusion of a cellular transmission device for effective communication. Ultimately, they require a solution that addresses their hardware requirements, enhances their oversight and understanding of pump station operations, and provides a viable financial model. The envisioned solution is pivotal in driving their commitment to becoming a leading knowledge provider in the electric motor field in Sweden.

## Hardware requirements
The hardware requirements for the project as noted are:

1. An industrial-grade device capable of reading and transmitting signals.
2. The hardware device should have:
   - 6 Digital Inputs (DI)
   - 1 Analog Input (AI)
   - 1 Digital Output (DO)
3. The device needs to convert Analog/Digital signals to a digital output.
4. Cell-enabled transmission capabilities.
5. Consideration for communication methods such as 5G, LTE, or LoRaWAN.
6. Potential for remote access to pump stations.
